YOLO (You Only Look Once) is one of the most popular object detector convolutional neural networks (CNNs). After Joseph Redmon et al. published their first YOLO paper in 2015, subsequent versions were published by them in 2016, 2017 and by Alexey Bochkovskiy in 2020. 

YOLOv7 is the new state-of-the-art object detector in the YOLO family. According to the paper, it is the fastest and most accurate real-time object detector to date. According to the YOLOv7 paper, the best model scored 56.8% Average Precision (AP), which is the highest among all known object detectors. The speed ranges from 5-160 FPS for various models (Available in the YOLOv7 GitHub repository - https://github.com/WongKinYiu/yolov7). Compared to the base models, YOLOv7 has reduced number of parameters to 40% and computation to 50%.
